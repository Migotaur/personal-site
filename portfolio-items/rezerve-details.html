              ReZerve was a web application designed for stylists to book appointments and manage their performance. Customers could search businesses, 
              check their availability, and request specific stylists from a business. Businesses also had opportunities to manage specific hours of 
              availability for certain stylists, list certain services for stylists, and track their business analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work on this project was in collaboration with a team of college seniors wanting to assist on the project for their Capstone class. 
              This was a very significant project for me as I became introduced to utlizing tools such as Git and React. Though my role was limited to 
              researching design tools (such as Material UI) and simple frontend work for the starting half of the project, this wouldn't last long. 
              When the capstone team finished their course, the site was still not ready to launch. In the Summer of 2021, I would take on a full stack 
              role and played a crucial role in getting the site launched. My responsibilites included integrating the Stripe Payment API, design many of 
              the business-to-employee functionality, and some revamping of the database schema (or unofficial schema, since Firestore was being used).
            </p>
            <p>
              The site was launched live in July 2021, garnering a couple of businesses in the DFW area to try it out. Rezerve would go offline 
              sometime in 2023.
